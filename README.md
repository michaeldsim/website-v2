# website-v2
This is the source code for my personal website. It was created in ReactJS to give myself some experience in front-end web libraries. I am sure there are some things that can be done better, so feel free to give me some advice!

# deployment
run ```yarn deploy``` in order to deploy to gh-pages and go to settings and set the custom domain name to your domain name.
